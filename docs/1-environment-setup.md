# Environment setup

---

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for this workshop are having `git` and `python` installed
([`python3.11`](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is recommended), as well as having a
[GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

The tutorial focuses on UNIX-based systems, but we will providing some tips on how to run the
commands on others.

You can choose to work on your own environment using any IDE, although there will be some extra
tips provided for a local workflow using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Creating your project

1. Create a new, public repository on your personal GitHub organisation from our
   [template project](https://github.com/aelsayed95/the-office), by clicking on the
   "[**Use this template**](https://github.com/aelsayed95/the-office/generate)" button.

2. Name your repo `the-office`, and check âœ… the option "**Include all branches**".

3. Clone your new repo locally:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:<your-org>/the-office.git
    cd the-office
    ```

4. Delete the `gh-pages` branch, both remotely and locally, so when you get to create yours there
   won't be any clashes!

    ```sh
    git push -d origin gh-pages
    ```

## Using a virtual environment

Next, we will be setting up a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html),
where later we will be installing everything else we need for the workshop.

```sh
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

{: .tip }
If you are using a different OS and/or shell the command to activate your virtual
environment might differ, so check the _Platform | Shell | Command_ table in the
[docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments).

In order to exit your virtual environment at any point, you can run:

```sh
deactivate
```
