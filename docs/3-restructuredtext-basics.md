# `reStructuredText` basics

---

[`reStructuredText`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) is
the default plaintext markup language used by Sphinx.

## The `index.rst` file

There are many tutorials out there explaining the syntax of `.rst` files that you can try a
separate time, so we will focus now on what exists in our `index.rst` file.

### Heading

```
Welcome to Sphinxy's documentation!
======================================
```

This is a heading containing the project name, as generated by Sphinx. In order to specify a new
section, create a heading by underlining the text with any punctuation character as long as the
text. Using the same character will create headings of the same level.

### Table of contents tree

```
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:
```

- The `toctree` (table of contents tree) adds structure to your docs.
- The `maxdepth` parameter specifies how many levels of headers you would like Sphinx to create in
  its output.
- The `caption` parameter gives option to provide a `toctree` caption, i.e. the _title_ of the
  `toctree`; in this case "Contents".

## Creating a section

Now let's add some more content by modifying the file `index.rst`. We are going to add a new
section that has some more information and a picture of a sphinx.

Create a new section **above** the "Indices and tables" one:

```
The Egyptian Sphinx
--------------------
```

### Image

And now let's add a picture to our new section. You can use any image you like; we downloaded one
from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com). You can find it under `images/sphinx.png`. Move your
preferred image in the `docs/_static` directory and type under your header:

```
.. image:: _static/sphinx.png
```

Now, from your `docs/` directory, re-run `make html` to see your image rendered on the site.
