# Automating documentation updates

---

So far, we've been manually building our documentation files locally, then pushing the output `html`
to GitHub Pages to host it. In this section, we will learn how to automate this process using
GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions allow GitHub users to automatically execute workflows. We can
use this to automate building and deploying new versions of our documentation.

## Creating a simple GitHub Action

First, let's build a simple GitHub Actions workflow to understand how it works. Let's create a
workflow that prints "Hello, World!" when a commit is pushed to `main`:

From your repo's root, create a new file `.github/workflows/hello.yaml` with the following
contents:

```yaml
name: Hello World

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  hello:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: say hello
        run: echo "Hello, World!"
```

This file defines a workflow named `Hello World`, which, when triggered, runs a single job `hello`
The job has a single step named `say hello` that prints `Hello, World!` to stdout. To test it out,
commit and push this file to `main`.

```sh
git add .github/workflows/hello.yaml
git commit -m "hello world workflow"
git push origin main
```

Now, navigate to the `Actions` tab on your repo's GitHub URL. You should see that a `workflow`
with the name `Hello World` has run. Click on the workflow, and click on the latest commit. Click
on the job `hello`. Now expand the step `say hello` to see its details. You should see the message
`Hello, World!` printed to stdout.

## Deploying your docs automatically

You now know how to build a simple workflow. Let's now write a workflow that would build and deploy
our documentation when a PR is merged. Create a new file `.github/workflows/docs.yaml` (find the
full file [here](#the-complete-deploy-documentation-github-action)):

```yaml
name: Deploy Documentation

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed
```

We'll trigger this workflow when a `pull_request` "closed" event occurs - meaning when a PR is
closed. See
[this reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows)
for a full list of events that trigger GitHub workflows. Next, let's define a job, we'll call it
`deploy docs`. We only want to trigger our workflow if a PR is merged, so we add the following
condition:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy_docs:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

Next, we need to define the `steps` that make up our job. First we setup Python, choose the
version, and install required dependencies:

```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: "3.10"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install sphinx furo
```

Next, we checkout the current repo, and configure GitHub to allow us to push to the `gh-pages`
branch:

```yaml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Git config
        run: |
          git config user.email "your email"
          git config user.name "your name"
```

Finally, we build our Sphinx documentation using `sphinx-build` (run by `make html`) and push the
output `_build/html` folder to `gh-pages`:

```yaml
      - name: Sphinx build
        run: |
          git worktree add docs/_build/html gh-pages
          cd docs
          make html
      - name: Deploy docs
        run: |
          cd docs/_build/html
          git add --all
          git commit -m "deploy documentation updates"
          git push origin gh-pages
```

#### The complete "Deploy Documentation" GitHub Action

Putting it all together, your `docs.yaml` should look like this:

```yaml
name: Deploy Documentation

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed

jobs:
  deploy_docs:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: "3.10"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install sphinx furo
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Git config
        run: |
          git config user.email "your email"
          git config user.name "your name"
      - name: Sphinx build
        run: |
          git worktree add docs/_build/html gh-pages
          cd docs
          make html
      - name: Deploy docs
        run: |
          cd docs/_build/html
          git add --all
          git commit -m "deploy documentation updates"
          git push origin gh-pages
```

Commit and push your file to `main`:

```sh
# from the project root
git add .github/workflows/docs.yaml
git commit -m "Add documentation build action"
git push origin main
```

To test out our new command, make a quick change to
`docs/index.rst`:

```
Welcome to The Office's documentation!
======================================

Explore The Office documentation.
```

Commit your change to a new branch `update_docs`:

```sh
# from the project root
git checkout -b update_docs
git add docs/index.rst
git commit -m "update docs"
git push origin update_docs
```

Now, create a PR to merge `update_docs` into `main`. From your repo's GitHub URL, create and
merge your PR. Go to the `Actions` tab, you should see that the workflow `Deploy Documentation` is
running. Click on it to observe the details of each step. Once all steps have completed, you'll see
that a new workflow `pages-build-deployment` has kicked off. This workflow is triggered by GitHub
when changes are pushed to `gh-pages`.

When this workflow is completed, refresh your GitHub Pages URL. You should see the new change on
your site.

With this new workflow in place, from now on every newly merged Pull Request into your project is
going to trigger a new deployment of your documentation!
