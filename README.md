# sphinx-tutorial

This repo is hosting the source files for the
[`sphinx-tutorial` website](https://olgarithms.github.io/sphinx-tutorial/).

This workshop will walk you through the steps of using the Sphinx tool for documentation
generation for a Python API, hosting them on GitHub Pages and automatically creating new versions
on code updates.

Accompanying the instructions there is
[this example project](https://github.com/aelsayed95/the-office) where you can find some sample
code to serve as a base for the rest of the workshop.

## Development

Install the dependencies:

```sh
bundle install
```

Build and serve the site:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

And navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4000 to enjoy!
